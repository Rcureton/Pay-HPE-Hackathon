It also gently whitens the teeth. Other toothpastes have irritated the inside of my mouth and didn't taste very good. I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I'm going to order more and stock up on it. I don't want to run out of this one. Try it. You will be happy you did.",

            "reviewText": "I've been using Colgate Sensitive Multiprotection for a few years now, and I love it. It's a little bit gritty, i.e. abrasive, which gives that clean feeling to your teeth. And the taste is great, much like some of the older Colgate Toothpaste products.\n\nBut recently, I haven't been finding it in the stores. So, I went on-line to Walmart.com, and there it was. So, I ordered a bunch. But when it arrived on my doorstep, it wasn't the same product. It's now called Colgate Sensitive Complete Protection. And while the UPC number is the same as the old one, the product is not the same. It's less gritty and the taste isn't as good.\n\nWhy do companies do this? You have a product that might not be selling as well as you like, so some genius brand manager decides to change it under the logic of \"new and improved\". But the reality is that your small loyal core leaves and not enough new people start to buy it. End result? Product dies! I've seen this movie too many times before. And it always ends the same way.\n\nUnless you bring back the original, you certainly lost me!",

For the price it works way better in my opinion that crest. Don't be fooled by expensive brands and multiple types, because then all have the legal amount of fluoride to use and same active ingredients.",
